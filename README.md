## What is Git?

Git is the open source distributed version control system. In other words, it is a program that helps you put a time-stamp to your files, so that you can keep track of all the changes.

## Audience

Intended for life scientists who are learning a new programming language or/and have an existing project with code (in any language) or text files that need track of changes. If you intend to make your code collaborative, bonus points for you!

## Aim

This short workshop aims to get you started with Git from zero. (If you already use Git this is too basic for you).

- Understand the concept of Git
- Create a repository for your project to keep track of changes
- Add messages to your changes
